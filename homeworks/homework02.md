### Think OS Chapter 2 reading questions

For each of the reading questions below, write answers in the form of
a clear, concise, complete sentence or two.

1. Give a real-world example of virtualization (ideally not one of 
the ones in the book).  What is abstractly true about the system that
is not literally true about the implementation?

2. What is the difference between a program and a process?

A process is a run of a program.

3. What is the primary purpose of the process abstraction? 

The purpose of process abstraction is making a process accessible for users by giving them the ability to use it without having an in depth understanding of how it works.

4. What illusion does the process abstraction create?

Process abstraction creates the illusion that some simple task is being performed when the actual implementation is typically a lot more complicated.

5. What is the kernel?

The kernel is a program that is responsible for core capabilities of a system.

6. What is a daemon?
